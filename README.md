# AV Controls

The *AV Controls* Firefox extension detects if you have HTML5 Audio or Video in a page and activates global visual and/or keyboard controls for it.

When a HTML5 media element is detected on a page the playback controls are displayed in the statusbar. With it the user can rewind, play/pause and seek the media. Switching to fullscreen is also possible from the statusbar if the [Full Screen Video extension][1] is also installed.

## Features

* always reachable controls in statusbar
* rewind, play/pause, seek, fullscreen
* ability to control the last visited HTML5 media item while on another tab

The last feature can be quite useful if you listen to the audio while reading something else on an other tab. You can still control the media item you have last visited.

## Things to expect

**Keyboard support is planned** but I'd like make it customizable which is tricky in Firefox. This feature is high up on the list.

**Volume control is also planned**. This shouldn't be so hard, just have to find some time to get to it.

I have some lower priority plans as well like supporting youtube videos. I have to look into it if it's at all possible. I also plan to make all of the media items across all open tabs available to control thourgh some clever menu popup.

I also welcome feature requests and bug reports at the [issues page](issues).
